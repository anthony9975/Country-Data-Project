This project was created as a data processing tool. If given an input CSV file with info about a country, it can seperate the data by years. It also can check for trends, allow you to change the data, and also give a summary of the data.
This project accepts file inputs. It goes through the files, creating Arrays for the year and data. It also creates a Country object for each country that stores all the data.
I created this project for a school assignment. It was a way to practice array, inputs, and object creation skills.
